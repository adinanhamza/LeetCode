389. Find the Difference

You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.

// Answ

class Solution {
  String findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
    var sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < t.length; i++)
      sum += t.codeUnitAt(i);
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length; i++)
      sum -= s.codeUnitAt(i);
    return String.fromCharCode(sum);
  }
}
